Welcome To Angular Simple Routing Project.You will find a simple routing solution for kickStarting your angular 10 Project.

Description of this version
Contains simple routing module with three routes, and 2 components created by me.<br/>
  a) The first route simply redirects to the home path.<br/>
  b) The second route have a component master layout attached and nested Child routes. /personal with child url will show child component.<br/>
  c) Anything other than the above two routes will redirect to Not-found Component.<br/>

The child components of second route are home-page.about-page,setting-page.

Navigation Bar shows the use of routerLink(path where you want to go) and routerLinkActive(css class to active path). 

This example demonstrates single level Routing. Next commit we'll see child routings as well.

Thanks
Rahul
