Welcome To Angular Simple Routing Project.You will find a simple routing solution for kickStarting your angular 10 Project.

Description of this version
Contains simple routing module with three routes, and 2 components created by me.
  a) The first route simply redirects to the home path.
  b) The second route have a component master layout component attached. /home with url will show master layout component.
  c) Anything other than the above two routes will redirect to Not-found Component.

This example demonstrates single level Routing. Next commit we'll see child routings as well.

Thanks
Rahul
